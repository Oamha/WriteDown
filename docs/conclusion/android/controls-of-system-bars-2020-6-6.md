## 系统栏的控制
::: tip 前言
 The system bars are screen areas dedicated to the display of notifications, communication of device status, and device navigation. Typically the system bars (which consist of the status and navigation bars) are displayed concurrently with your app. Apps that display immersive content, such as movies or images, can temporarily dim the system bar icons for a less distracting experience, or temporarily hide the bars for a fully immersive experience.

If you're familiar with the Android Design Guide, you know the importance of designing your apps to conform to standard Android UI guidelines and usage patterns. You should carefully consider your users' needs and expectations before modifying the system bars, since they give users a standard way of navigating a device and viewing its status.
